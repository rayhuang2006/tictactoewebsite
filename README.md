# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid with their respective symbols (X and O). The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the empty squares of the grid.
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
5. When the game ends, a popup will display the result, and a "Reset Game" button will appear below the game board to restart the game.
